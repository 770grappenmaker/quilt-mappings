CLASS net/minecraft/unmapped/C_qvfggwhk net/minecraft/util/math/AffineTransformation
	COMMENT An affine transformation is a decomposition of a 4&times;4 real matrix into
	COMMENT a {@linkplain #rotation1 rotation} quaternion, a {@linkplain #scale scale}
	COMMENT 3-vector, a second {@linkplain #rotation2 rotation} quaternion, and a
	COMMENT {@linkplain #translation translation} 3-vector. It is also known as "TRSR"
	COMMENT transformation, meaning "translation rotation scale rotation".
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>This class is immutable; its matrix is lazily decomposed upon demand.
